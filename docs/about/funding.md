# Budget and Event Funding

_These guidelines were last updated on 11/20/2025._

DormCon
[maintains a budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPuOOGkemUujGznduOHi4RSK1Wza2Hxgu3fIhYua50Q/edit?usp=sharing)
in order to help fund events in the dorm community and for operational expenses.
We are committed to keeping extraneous costs low in order to maximize the amount
of money available for events that enhance the residential experience. As
[approved by dorm presidents](https://web-cert.mit.edu/dormcon/cert_minutes/2024-02-29.pdf),
DormCon receives $10 of house tax from every dorm resident.

In addition, beginning Spring 2026, DormCon is receiving funding to distribute
to residence halls for large events from the MIT Division of Student Life in
lieu of (now defunct) LEF/ARCADE grants. This is in recognition of the value
that undergraduate residence halls have on the student experience, and is fully
distributed directly to dorms every semester based on request. Furthermore,
DormCon annually funds campus-wide events such as Campus Preview Weekend (CPW),
Residential Exploration (REX), and DormCon Apple Picking, as well as individual
dorm events, inter-dorm events, and events sponsored by individual dorm
residents.

All funding requests are first reviewed by the DormCon Treasurer then voted on
by the dorm presidents at a general body meeting, and a representative of the
group/organization requesting funding may be requested to attend as needed. This
is to ensure a spirit of transparency, collaboration, and fiscal responsibility.
Any questions should be directed to the DormCon Treasurer by emailing
[dormcon-treasurer@mit.edu](mailto:dormcon-treasurer@mit.edu).
