# Budget and Funding Guidelines

DormCon [maintains a budget][budget] in order to help fund events in the dorm
community and for operational expenses. We are committed to keeping extraneous
costs low in order to maximize the amount of money available for events that
enhance the residential experience. As [approved by dorm presidents][tax],
DormCon receives $10 of house tax from every dorm resident.

In addition, beginning Spring 2026, DormCon is receiving additional semesterly
funding to distribute to residence halls for large events from the MIT Division
of Student Life, in lieu of (now defunct) LEF/ARCADE grants.[^1] This is in
recognition of the value that undergraduate residence halls have on the student
experience, and is fully distributed directly to dorms every semester based on
request. Furthermore, DormCon annually funds campus-wide events such as
[Campus Preview Weekend (CPW)](https://cpwcommunity.mit.edu/),
[Residential Exploration (REX)](/rex), and
[DormCon Apple Picking](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-picked-my-first-apple/),
as well as individual dorm events, inter-dorm events, and events sponsored by
individual dorm residents.

## Funding Guidelines

All funding requests are first reviewed by the DormCon Treasurer, then voted on
by the dorm presidents at a general body meeting, and a representative of the
group/organization requesting funding may be requested to attend as needed. This
is to ensure a spirit of transparency, collaboration, and fiscal responsibility.
Any questions should be directed to the DormCon Treasurer by emailing
<dormcon-treasurer@mit.edu>.

_These guidelines were last updated on 1/31/2026._

    Due to increased funding directly from DSL, residence halls are no longer
    eligible for SGFC funding (which took over funding from the ASA's LEF/ARCADE
    grants, UA's FinBoard, and GSC's Funding Board). More information on what
    led to the creation of the SGFC can be found in the final report of the the
    [Student Organization Working Group](https://studentlife.mit.edu/campus-communities/student-activities/student-organization-working-group/).
