# Officers

DormCon advocates for the interests and needs of all dorm residents. As a group,
DormCon exec meets once a week on Thursday nights. While chairs are responsible
for specific areas of focus, all members of DormCon exec are involved in the
discussions we have about student life issues and policies, and give input on
the policies we advocate for.

## Positions

### [President](mailto:dormcon-president@mit.edu) & [Vice President](mailto:dormcon-vp@mit.edu)

The DormCon President & Vice President lead DormCon and represent DormCon to
other groups and organizations. While the DormCon President may take on slightly
more responsibility, the President and Vice President generally act as equal
partners. They meet regularly with administrators such as the Dean of Student
Life and the Chancellor to discuss issues related to all aspects of residential
life and focus on larger, long-term projects not specific to any chair. Within
DormCon, they set the agenda for meetings with exec and the presidents, and
provide guidance to other members of DormCon.

To contact the DormCon President & Vice President directly, feel free to email
dormcon-execest@mit.edu.

### [Treasurer](mailto:dormcon-treasurer@mit.edu)

The Treasurer is responsible for all of the financial transactions of DormCon.
They oversee the receipt and payment of the money of DormCon, ensure timely
reimbursement to anyone who has spent money on the authorization of DormCon, and
monitor all of DormCon's financial account activity. The Treasurer also keeps
DormCon's permanent financial records and submits regular written reports about
the state of DormCon's finances. They create a budget to be approved by DormCon
in accordance with the Dormitory Council Budgeting Guidelines. The Treasurer
also keeps copies of all reports of a financial nature presented to DormCon.

### [Secretary](mailto:dormcon-secretary@mit.edu)

The DormCon Secretary schedules meetings, sends out reminders, and takes minutes
for DormCon meetings. They also lead publicity efforts through the DormCon
social media pages (Instagram and Twitter). Because this position requires
taking meeting minutes, it is necessary that they are able to attend meetings
during the regular time of Thursday evenings.

### [CPW/REX Chairs](mailto:dormcon-rexvp@mit.edu)

The DormCon CPW/REX chairs oversee all of the dormitories' events during two of
the best times of the year. They work closely with Admissions in creating the
CPW booklet and communicate with dorm CPW chairs to ensure a great CPW. They are
also responsible for coordinating REX (Residential EXploration) and publishing
the REX booklet by working with all of the dorms. This is a great opportunity to
have a say in the way that MIT welcomes first-years!

### [Housing Chairs](mailto:dormcon-housing-chair@mit.edu)

The DormCon Housing Chair is responsible for all things housing and is the
interface between DormCon, Housing, and ResLife. They advocate for students on
long term initiatives, help housing handle issues that come up, advise on
housing timelines and residential life initiatives, review communications
housing sends out, and more!

### [JudComm Chairs](mailto:dormcon-judcomm-chair@mit.edu)

JudComm interprets the constitution, leads efforts to amend the constitution,
and runs elections. They hold DormCon accountable to the constitution and are
consulted whenever we consider modifying the constitution. JudComm may also take
on additional responsibilities not specific to any other position.

### [Underclassmen Representatives](mailto:dormcon-uc-rep@mit.edu)

The DormCon Underclassmen Representatives serve as ambassadors paying special
attention to the interests of first and second years living in dorms. In
addition, the role is flexible to allow the representatives to participate in
various projects and initiatives as they feel the need. Being an underclassmen
rep is a great way to get involved with DormCon in a broader capacity and bring
your perspective to a wide variety of issues! It is also a great way to get
started in dorm student government and start gaining experience.

### [Dining Chairs](mailto:dormcon-dining-chair@mit.edu)

The DormCon Dining Chairs are DormCon's main advocates on food and
dining-related issues. They represent the interests of both dining and
cook-for-yourself dorms in discussions related to house & retail dining. Recent
concerns include quality, flexibility, & affordability of the meal plans, food
insecurity, and sustainability on campus.

### [i3 Chair](mailto:dormcon-i3-rac-chair@mit.edu)

The DormCon i3 chair is the student point person for making the i3 project
happen! The i3 (Interactive Introduction to the Institute) serves to introduce
the incoming first-years to the various wonderful dorms and dorm cultures at
MIT. To showcase this, each dorm creates an i3 video and/or house tour which is
ultimately posted in the
[Guide to Residences](https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/). The i3 Chair helps
coordinate the process of creating and distributing the i3s by coordinating
between administrators and the dorm i3 chairs.

### [Tech Chair](mailto:dormcon-tech-chair@mit.edu)

The DormCon Tech Chair is responsible for all things regarding student
computing, with a specific slant towards covering dorm-related issues.
Generally, this means:

- Interfacing w/ IS&T and individual dorms about student computing
- Helping maintain the DormCon website (which is made of React and Markdown)
- Uploading GBM minutes for public view
- Running the digital components of REX
- Taking on other projects where other DormCon chairs need assistance,
  especially from a technical standpoint

The DormCon Tech Chair is one of the more flexible roles on DormCon. They're
also welcome to just update the website (which is all nice and brand new now!),
but they're also expected to be the nerd in the room when tech stuff is needed
for dorm-related projects. In the past, this has included a decent amount of
work for REX.
