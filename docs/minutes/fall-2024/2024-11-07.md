## Full Minutes

### Exec Updates

- Eugenie (Underclassmen rep)
    - Met with Mark and Heather for Stata food availability, they explained why
      there aren’t meal swipes/why it’s expensive \- they think Stata is cheap
      (“all food on campus is cheap compared to other schools/off-campus food”)
      \- students have the perception that it should be cheaper, and they feel
      like the price is already fair
    - talked about sending out new survey
        - idea \- could use meal swipes at Stata, but wouldn’t get whole value,
          e.g. $14-15
        - problem if people eat at Stata and not dining halls
        - “debt”
    - they’re concerned because they’re already in debt, don’t want to spend
      even more money
    - another survey question \- how much do you normally buy
    - need more options \- people don’t eat lunch
    - everyone is under a union, lots of constraints that make it
      complicated/expensive
- Leo (Treasurer)
    - will need to be collecting $ for apple-picking
    - hopefully will just debit us \- depends on SOLE
    - otherwise, dorm presidents might get a form for people to sign
    - SOLE is not giving DormCon their money
        - emailing daily asking “where’s the house tax???”
        - concerning
        - Ramon is out of office this week, so emails are not being answered
          (makes sense)
    - will send out how much each dorm owes for apple-picking
        - everything is \<$1500
        - you get $ into your dorm’s account however is convenient (e.g., cash
          deposit slip from SOLE)
    - you take cash \+ the cash deposit slip to the Bank of America
        - “MIT doesn’t bank at the MIT Bank.” “That makes sense.”
    - can also make a donation to the dorm (MIT Giving Page) \- then treasurer
      is on the record of people who have given $ to MIT (you get mail from MIT
      saying you’re a big giver 😭)
    - RFPs may be blocked \- talk to Leo if this is causing problems
- Felicity

          across differences” in dorms
        - want to start a working group around an infographic
            - want house teams to create “conversation documents”
            - where people should go in different domains
            - Temkin showed graph from 2021 with bubbles (from 8.01), about
              navigating the resources at MIT
                - very fancy bubble graph O.O
                - [Navigating Resources at MIT](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/2a1cd8f8-ce7e-4398-b4b5-655c81cb54cc/view?page=0_0#)
                - made in 2020 so maybe outdated \- “issues with virtual
                  learning”
            - looking for student input \- they will follow up
    - HRS meeting
        - McCormick renovations
            - issues with transition team (McCormick has also mentioned this)
            - survey closing

        - talked about facilities issues
            - Next House elevator is struggling
            - laundry
                - push notification when a laundry goes down for 30 minutes

                    - “that’s never happened before”
            - how many facilities problems do they actually know about?
                - simmons elevators \- how many times on their log has simmons
                  elevator been down \- 3 in the calendar year
                    - “I said ‘that’s funny.’” \- temkin
        - personal wheels
            - BELIEVE IT OR NOT there’s not that much bike storage in dorms
            - grad students also complaining
            - want to put a shed by Tang and West Gate? moratorium is sad :(
                - David was so convinced there was a moratorium (Vice Provost
                  for Space) \- but this is a little bit secret?
            - guidelines aren’t very good, posters aren’t very good
            - they don’t want things Blocking Egress
        - at one point they invited fire department and smoked up a floor in EC
          :D so much excitement
            - to show people why not to block egresses
            - would dorms be interested? YEAH
                - “it’s like an escape room\!” \- ananda
            - Simmons, Baker, Next, Random, EC (next year), BC
        - student website will be out in the spring\! will consolidate
          information\!
- Gabriel (Tech Chair)
    - SIPB is cool with how-to-dormspam
    - they called Gabriel Brandon in an email (???)
- Daniel (Dining)
    - dining will be part of joint website, including the menu 0.0
    - meeting was cancelled due to the election \>.\<
    - alternative to the metal green box program
        - they’re going hard
        - they’re maybe okay with extending return time
        - going to Increase Student Accountability, which will be Great For
          Everyone\!
        - bento box \+ cup \+ silverware \- all rented out
            - “usefull”
            - [https://www.usefull.us/](https://www.usefull.us/)
        - it’s like a library book \- if you don’t return in time, you get
          charged (fined)
            - can extend the initial return time
        - context \- they lose hundreds of green boxes, and keep having to order
          more silverware also \>.\<
            - “who would steal forks?” “not me. not me. …well….”
        - the charges would be through usefull
            - and also gets charged through your credit card (have to have a
              credit card on file) \- so not enormously easy to sign up
        - needs to be a lot of communication, if the sign-up process is not
          super intuitive, also means you have to have a credit card
            - credit card or debit card
            - some students won’t have compatible ones with US system,
              especially international students
        - each piece of ware is $16, so the charge can stack up
        - when will it be implemented?
            - they’re looking at how much it would cost to switch programs \- no
              specific timeframe yet
            - they don’t want to use green boxes anymore
        - weeks, months, or years?
            - heather really wants it, but doesn’t know if her proposal will get
              approved
            - definitely no earlier than next semester, probably later than that
        - take-away is that green boxes are not sustainable, definitely moving
          to something like Usefull
            - they belong to bon appetit
        - ananda could see fun events at dining about the new program \- new
          thing
            - otherwise will leave a sour taste in people’s mouths
            - people are salty about no more to-go cups, if they had done
              something with like reusable cups, people might have been happier,
              less abrupt and sad
            - makes people feel more positive about dining
            - Q+A or info session, if you argue it’s more sustainable, frame it
              positively (and explain why it happens)
            - “MIT is doing something cool for once”
        - concern about encouraging people to steal food?
            - benefit with green box \- it’s so easy, hypothetically bringing a
              ziploc bag to dining
            - green boxes are more convenient than that
            - if you increase activation energy of borrowing food, encourage
              people to go around the system (bring their own Tupperware)
            - their response would be “we have people Watching”
            - people are going to steal food regardless
            - once you’ve made an account it’s as easy as a green box
            - “more convenient to have a Usefull box than a Ziploc bag full of
              chicken”
    - difference between plate waste and overproduction (e.g., students throw
      away, vs. food that is never served)
        - trying to figure out where food waste is coming from
        - composting in CFY dorms
        - waste-watchers also exist
    - Maseeh Dining will be closed next Monday
        - they’ll hopefully email to everyone, otherwise we’ll dormspam
        - they emailed dorm presidents asking us to email, doesn’t make sense,
          asked them to send their own emails please
    - “transformational experience of being lied to”
    - no update regarding Cnocord Market tour, no meeting this week, sad
    - hopefully an 11/21 GBM with Concord Market
        - Mark hasn’t talked to Concord Market, had to cancel the meeting
        - Concord said “we can’t talk today.” 😭
    - which dorms have compost bins
        - McCormick, Baker, Simmons have dining hall bins
        - Random has food waste bins
    - MIT does not compost but they do something else exciting O.O
    - Simmons and Random have them in lounges/kitches
    - McCormick and Baker do not have them in lounges or kitchens, only in
      dining halls
- Jordan (President)
    - “pay your apple bills”
    - met with Suzy et. al. last week
        - email to dining committee about the future of dining
            - let Jordan know if there are people suited to being on the dining
              working committee
        - MedLinks can’t give out medicine
            - Suzy is really sad about the election :((
            - will talk to MIT Medical about that
            - at training \- it’s liability
            - lots of mental health training
            - holding liability over student health \+ wellbeing\!\!
            - much safer to have MedLinks give stuff out
            - MedLinks give things out “as friends”
                - but then the cost comes out of their pocket \>.\<
        - RPMs
            - Helen wants RPMs to “feel like a cohort” and do stuff
            - we’re having a dinner tomorrow at 4:30
                - I have a lab meeting :((
            - how to make the RPM program better?
                - talked to AD \- thinks RPMs could be useful for life skills \-
                  sewing, cooking, how to remove a stain \- sewing kits are
                  cheap, RPM budget is low, low-budget but genuinely useful
                    - so true
                - giving RPMs something MedLink-like
                    - every RPM has a small sewing kit
                    - “I would fuck with an iron. Like for me.” \-temkin
                - how to scour a pan
                    - …how to… wash… your dishes…
            - real benefit of RPMs is to exist in spaces where freshmen are
                - could work with GRAs more?
                - they supplement budget sometimes
                - underfunded program
                - $50 per RPM
            - they’re doing a social for all the RPMs
                - there was one in August
                    - I think I was in California?
    - Concord Market GBM
        - tentatively planned on the **21st of November**
        - unless someone would LOVE to host, will be in a classroom
            - BC could host if they want a host
            - will be in touch
            - BC is CFY, so residents might be interested
            - kind of central on dorm row, in a good spot
        - \#1 question will be Prices. but last time they spoke, it was “who
          knows?”
            - asked about prices in a meeting \- not clear if they’ll know
            - will be useful anyway
            - top thing to talk about when they come
            - dining chairs will follow up after the forum
            - dining chairs will have more legitimacy in asking about prices
              when it happens that Every Student asks

### DSL Visiting Committee

- MIT Corporation \- every two years, they send members of the Corporation to
  **Investigate** every department at MIT O.O
    - they have a lot of power and listen to constituents (...do they…?)
    - from student life perspective, what do they want brought up to Committee?
        - jordan, ananda, temkin on student life, pres of IFC and PanHel, a GRA,
          Enoch
    - what is going well in student life?
    - what is not going well in student life?
    - what would you change?
    - PLEASURE has gone through a lot of administrators, long list of people who
      were in charge, only one person, bumped up \# of trainings that PLEASURE
      educators do
        - twenty-six fraternities, all the sororities, sports teams, so much for
          one person
        - new advisor every semester, so much turn-over, everything is a mess,
          it’s like a full-time job to run all the trainings
        - they’re literally students
        - good that there’s peer education, but there isn’t enough
          administrative support to make an impact
        - the frats hate them \>.\< and the frat interfacing chair
        - really difficult and really important \- lots of burden on students,
          better than hiring people (what MIT used to do) \- didn’t deliver
          content that mattered to students, not in touch, need more support
          from an administrative side
        - Orientation also changing sex education program
        - PLEASURE under VPR, usually both advisors are VPR employees \- there
          isn’t like a specific role \- someone got transferred away from
          PLEASURE, moved to West Coast, still working at MIT, but reduced \# of
          positions for advisors for PLEASURE (2 \=\> 1, not enough with
          increased trainings)
        - technically 60 PLEASURE educators, actually like 25
        - get a lot of flack for not being able to meet deadlines \- sometimes
          trainings get canceled (not enough educators)
    - Slow decline of things that have been inherent to east side culture
      (murals, cats, toptionality, etc.)
        - Necessary to be reiterated
        - Between 50-90% of what you’re fighting for is what already exists and
          you’re just fighting for what’s already there
        - something MIT relies on heavily for PR and advertising to incoming
          students, shouldn’t keep taking it away
        - CPW and REX are exhausting, especially CPW
            - so much burden on students
            - should be fun to meet incoming students, difficult to do every
              year, at a bad time in the semester
            - day off of school would do wonders for student mental health, not
              just Marathon Monday
            - REX is less bad, but CPW is really hard for students
            - there was less time during this year’s REX
        - for REX and CPW both, the general point is that student contribution
          to making the Institute what it is should be valued
            - everything is a selling point, but behind the scenes, it’s a
              constant battle to let them happen
            - feeding early returns was a struggle for EC (and for Random)
        - what would make you feel more supported?
            - grace with classes could do a lot (for CPW stress)
            - meal swipes?
- in general \- as a student leader \- what would make you feel more supported?
    - twin mattresses for kids for CPW would be good \- there are always
      problems
        - Admissions is buying a lot of air mattresses (lol)
        - making sure CPW kids have food is a struggle \- not always real food,
          just boba etc.
    - credit to Alan \- VP before the VP before Ananda (“my grandfather”) \-
      original creator of proposal
        - major actionable thing \- RFP system should be overhauled
        - as Alan put it, RFP system is students making many interest-free loans
          to MIT to pay for things
        - Next and any dorm that has ever tried to get a card knows it’s very,
          very, very difficult
        - this goes into a broader point that oftentimes, admin puts a lot of
          unnecessary red tape (or yellow? no, red) around things we want to do
            - lowering the amount of red tape would be helpful
    - meeting with SOLE
        - after poster incident \- they hired someone to chaperone the UA
          (Connor)
            - “they hired me because of David Spicer”
        - there is someone in that office dedicated to actively support the
          actions of a student group
            - great that they took note of that, a lot of student government is
              students trying and yelling and hoping for the best, but could use
              more support
        - SOLE advisor?
            - “a bestie”
        - Someone who can advocate, when students are always expected to be the
          ones communicating
            - hiding behind student leaders \- supposed to be the middle man
        - Connor is a powerhouse \- getting the history committee a muraling
          space, and now the Stud is a muraling space
        - “we need to do something _crazy_ on DormCon so they hire a babysitter
          for us”
        - Connor didn’t approve RFP for Gucci suits
    - seconding the RFP thing
        - tax exemption is really hard, secretary didn’t know how to do tax
          exemption, losing $10 a week
        - people tipped a driver and lost the money (not on the receipt)
        - so frustrating to lose money on these things
        - so many things require so many hurdles and have to do them over and
          over
        - MIT as an organization makes some things really accessible, like the
          Atlas app, so easy to do complicated things \- could be way easier
        - digital infrastructure is archaic
        - frustrating because it’s so time-consuming even to submit an RFP and
          get it approved
            - lol i have so many RFPs i’ve been procrastinating 😭
        - someone else was treasurer before, has floor reimbursements,
          treasurers are stuck filing a bunch of RFPs, everyone waits till the
          end to submit them (it’s me. i’m the problem.)
        - get AD to do bigger purchases \- ADs get quicker access to p card
        - Buy2Pay is not intuitive, so confusing, no one uses it
            - designed for labs with a full-time administrative assistant
    - things that are most difficult about student life are red tape
        - hoops and hurdles
        - RFPs, fighting for student culture
        - offices that are hiding behind student leaders for decisions \-
          reliance on students to do things without support
        - \+1 from Camila
            - admin proposed that the UA send out an email to all undergrads abt
              October 7th
        - we don’t know where the buck stops (?)
            - who has the power to change anything? if it were known? who do I
              go to, if there’s a committee that needs to be made, an individual
              administrator, knowing who possesses the power, knowing who to
              deal with
            - so much bureaucracy,
              [https://orgchart.mit.edu/](https://orgchart.mit.edu/)
        - \+1 from Leo
            - I don’t want other dorms to have to escalate to House Manager’s
              boss’s boss to get showers fixed 😭
            - threatened to report HRS to city
        - last point \- hesitant to characterize as red tape, makes it seem
          reasonable/justified, concerns are hoops and hurdles, obstacles, no
          safety concern
        - placing liability over student well-being is bad \- it’s all
          liability, all ends up with MIT trying to shirk liability
            - passing difficulties onto students

              or they’d report it, mailing list emailed back, said it was
