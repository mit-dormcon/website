          January)
        - DSL is hosting a petting zoo on in Lobby 13
            - Ananda and Jordan just… asked them?
        - moral concerns? but there will be a petting zoo.

        - current word: DSL would Really Really like it if you Told Your
          Communities To Be Nice To Each Other (“please uwu”)
        - if your dorm approves emails \- if you are in a position to approve an
          email \- if you or whoever or your webchair didn’t approve anything
          that would cause “erosion of trust”
            - no details on what that means 😭
        - recommendation is that dormspam should only have current students,
          non-students can be on separate list (e.g., random-hall-dormspam vs.
          r-h-t)
        - no timeline, no current guidelines, just “tell your communities to be
          nice to each other”

    - cpw/rex
    - i3
- how it works
    - will announce position to be elected, give brief description, \# of people
      who can be elected
    - can be nominated by anyone in the room, “consent is good”, must accept
      nomination
    - will have a nomination period, each candidate will have 60 seconds to
      present themselves, why they want to be on dormcon, their platform
    - questions from previous position holders, dorm presidents, exec, general
      body. will be time-limited
    - you can ask follow-ups, but don’t ask a question that was answered in the
      form
      ([responses were sent out)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7fY8ETYxeZTc1BGpQdyOO5FA-CAXQYLs-z3NJe2BZM/edit?usp=sharing)
    - will send candidates out of room, open to deliberations
    - vote, then will follow up with run-off, if more than two
    - presidents have votes equivalent to the max capacity of their dorm ( :( )
      \- give votes in percentages
    - if you are a dorm resident, you can vote independently of dorm president,
      but you get one singular resident’s vote

          about regulations, communicating them to dorm i3 chairs, making things
          are done on time, etc.
        - no formal experience needed \- just need to be able to write emails
          and respond to them in a timely manner
    - 1-2 hours per week at maximum (most weeks not that)
    - mostly bugging people
    - might be expanded somewhat? HRS wants to bring back booklets (?) \- i3
      branding \- a “branding experience” \- redesigning the guide to residence
      website every year, adding a splash to the videos

    - great way to be involved in DormCon

          Jackson
            - that’s also respectfully terrifying?

      but students think are normal?
        - for the dorm to judge, could argue on that \- Ivan
        - in general \- type of person who likes rules to make sense, so would
          push back \- Jackson
    - how do you feel about the other direction (telling students they can’t do
      something)

        - will be cases where HRS says something and I can’t do anything \- i3
