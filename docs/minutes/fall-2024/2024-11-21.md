### Introduction from Mark

- History of La Verde’s
    - Back when Mark got here in 2018, they had Verde’s, run by Frank La Verde,
      first sold to Boston University, then to a dining contractor
    - Two years ago in April, they decided it wasn’t working and left. This was
      also a time of struggle for the Stud (floods, renovations, etc.)
    - The space is managed by MITIMCo, Mark is going to show pictures
    - Mark knows a lot of history about it\!
    - La Verde’s never had any sort of student satisfaction survey, no feedback,
      they want it to better suit needs of students, staff, and faculty
    - No one liked La Verde’s, but then they left and people loved them because
      we missed them 🙁
    - Concord Market will collect more feedback than La Verde’s\! There are QR
      codes on the windows with a feedback form\!

### Questions from Students

- What will the beverages selection look like?
    - a lot of different kinds of beverages
    - large beverage cooler
    - they brought a row of example sodas to show us (culture pop, other natural
      brands) \- Concord Market exists in “the natural channel”
    - seltzer, water, Gatorade, Coke, in specialty natural brands
    - kombucha on tap
    - barista counter
    - smoothies
    - teas and juices (in-house)
    - Will there be Arizona Iced Tea?
        - yes \- “I think we have to.”
    - There will be Coke and other standard brands as well as the natural brands
- What does the pricing model look like compared to other places around here?
  And is there a way to integrate TechCash/meal swipes?
    - plan is to accept TechCash and dining dollars
    - there are two people who control those things at MIT, and they’re working
      with them \- working on a way to integrate into one terminal (or a second
      terminal)
    - dining dollars will probably only work on food, techcash on anything in
      the store
- Pricing compared to other things in the area?
    - not super expensive
    - some commodity lines, some specialty lines
    - “would not call it expensive”, have heard the concern from students over
      prices many times and know it’s a main priority
    - with their current one small store, hard to get top line pricing, but with
      the second (MIT) store, they’ll have more leverage to get lower prices
    - Steve has been working hard on this, will be his main job \- talking to
      vendors to get lowest prices possible
    - They hear us\! and will do their best to get us the best prices possible
- How will you incorporate feedback?
    - working with marketing person for dining\! (Amanda)
    - will incorporate QR code on posters, links to a feedback form
    - [dormcon.mit.edu/concord](http://dormcon.mit.edu/concord)
    - also in-person things \- customers say things like “Steve, can you make
      the chicken better?”
        - and then presumably Steve makes the chicken better
    - They will both be in-store regularly, so people can talk to them in person
    - won’t keep carrying foods that people don’t like, since that won’t serve
      us or them
    - Excited to hear what people think\!
    - Mark \- there’s a common problem with getting feedback about things, want
      to funnel it through somewhere (through the QR code or somewhere else)
        - it will go to DormCon leadership, Dining leadership, and Concord
          Market leadership
    - also something similar to comment cards in dining halls?
    - is this the best way of doing it?
        - form is nice because it’s anonymous
        - can also re-address if it’s not working
    - Mark \- put the QR code on receipts if possible?
        - still at the beginning point with the systems, but should be able to
          do that
        - Faith has to do a six-hour training for the POS system (point-of-sale)
- What are the open hours going to look like, especially on the weekends?
    - **7am-10pm, 7 days a week**
    - will collect data
        - “first year of business is mainly data collection”
    - will also have 24-hour vending machine
    - La Verdes used to be 24-hour, then went to 2am, eventually got to 11 or 12
    - used to be easier to get staff who would work late hours
        - staffing is their main concern
        - just hired the executive chef, will handle operations, so Steve can
          focus on pricing/operational
        - “if any of you want jobs, we’ll take your resume right now”
            - “when is my first day on the job”
    - they’re opening **February 2nd**
    - are you planning on hiring students?
        - “if you’ll work”
        - would be through Concord Market, not through MIT \- commercial space,
          they pay rent to MIT
- What will the loyalty program look like?
    - similar to when you shop at Target and get points
    - point-of-sale system has that capability \- can collect data on users,
      make your own account
    - once they’re operating with groceries to-go, can have an account, earn
      points, apply to coupons, etc.
    - currently building out the loyalty system (e.g., get your tenth coffee
      free)
    - probably won’t start immediately (they don’t do it at their Concord
      store), so figuring out what it’ll look like
    - they’re excited\!
- Since MIT students are split into cook-for-yourself vs. dining hall students,
  have you thought about meeting needs of each group \- what is the split
  between grocery section and prepared food?
    - Faith: What do you think would be the main difference between the groups?
        - people who cook for themselves are looking for groceries/pantry items,
          other group might be looking for prepared food, ready-to-eat things,
          snacks
            - “I love snacks.” \- Faith
    - definitely going to have diapers, baby stuff, pet stuff, housewares, bags,
      tupperware, etc.
    - main focus will be on ready-to-eat items
    - can’t give exact percentage, but will be a little of everything, will be a
      healthy mix of both
    - Menus are still getting finalized
    - For things like raw meat, people from dining hall dorms might not want
      that, but they still plan to carry a little.
    - Faith and the owner are going through catalogs and still finalizing
      decisions\! There also might be some adjustment once they open/see what
      sells.
- Any steps already taken regarding reducing food waste, and maybe including
  reusables?
    - At the store in concord \- if there are things on the shelves that aren’t
      moving \- Faith will tell Steve, and then Steve will use them for the
      prepared food
        - last year they had eight cases of soba, and a lot of shortening
        - the beauty of having the kitchen, can eat a lot of their own waste
    - They also partner with food banks
        - work with OpenTable in Concord \- when prepared food starts going bad,
          they donate it
        - then eventually goes to compost
    - Staff regularly go onto shelves, take older items from produce to get
      cooked
        - fresh produce hits the shelves, but less fresh produce gets used for
          cooking
        - can make sauteed spinach, vegetable stock, can freeze things, etc.
    - Faith \- Someone mentioned a green boxes?
        - Mark \- it’s a reusable container \- you check it out from dining,
          good for 300 uses, you bring it back and it gets washed, clamshell box
          of recycled plastic
        - like a Styrofoam take-out box, but not Styrofoam
        - Concord Market could have them, but would have to own the cleaning of
          them
        - Maybe easier to do a discount for bringing your own container or mug?
        - For green boxes, there would have to be a washing system \- better to
          do ownership \- if they disappear, they eat the cost
        - worth looking at, since there’s a dishwasher?
        - This is something else to grow into \- it’s hard to work out all the
          small programming from the start
    - Reusable coffee mugs are a good idea\!
    - For container materials, Steve is working on the research
        - they already use eco-friendly plastic
        - looking into paper-based materials that hold up to liquids, if they
          have to sit on a shelf
        - they want something that’s eco-friendly, consumer-friendly, and
          cost-effective
        - already have meetings set up to start talking about packaging with
          vendors
        - some of them service cambridge, have ideas of where to start
    - Mark \- other good thing about coming to the area \- lots of local
      resources to explore, packaging, reusable container options
        - lots of food and sustainability research around
    - They do hope to have all these programs eventually\!
- Bringing reusable mugs? Does concord market already do this? For
  coffee/espresso?
    - might not start with it, but will incorporate
- Relative to other places (on campus or nearby) \- any sense of pricing of
  meals?
    - have looked at various campus markets at other campuses, in surrounding
      area, trying to find a sweet price point
    - checked out La Verdes before they closed, as well as restaurants upstairs
      in the Stud
    - will come down to portion sizes, etc.
        - haven’t nailed it down yet, would love to tell us exactly, but Steve
          needs to sit down the chef and decide exactly
        - portion sizes so that food is a full meal, but also reasonably priced
    - a lot of the food will be sold by weight (e.g., soup?)
    - likely to have special deals, like a chips, drink, and sandwich discount
- Faith \- does anyone recognize any of the products on the podium? (they
  brought products from a number of natural brands\!)
    - people like the Made Good granola bars
    - “lots to expose you guys to”
    - Faith has the backstory on the guy who founded the El Nacho chip company
      after leaving another chip company
        - “same chip but better because it’s not… _shady_.”
    - Vendors might come in to the market and advertise
        - On the week they open \- the first day is a Sunday \- they’ll do a
          soft launch, will make sure everything is running smoothly
        - will be working with vendors to schedule tastings, have vendors bring
          swag, t-shirts, etc.
- What is the shelf life of things? Like, if students take prepared food home
  and refrigerate it?
    - Refrigerated prepared items are generally kept on the shelves for a
      maximum of four days \- so if someone buys it on the fourth day, it will
      still be okay for at least a couple days
    - they make sure to date-check regularly \- everything has to go on time
    - will check on the freshness, big part of their job
    - some things last longer, like dips, etc., things with lots of sugar
- Are there going to be sandwiches?
    - will have deli sandwiches that can be pressed into paninis, stacked in a
      French bistro style
    - also sandwiches on prepared-food wall (classic sandwiches)
    - some that can be pressed hot, plus some on the shelf to grab and go
    - trying to maximize convenience and variety
    - not like a subway, not make your own, but will be a rotating selection
    - ones in la verdes were not make your own, but were named after dorms\!
        - naming idea is fun :) majors and dorms\!
        - Faith makes the menu names punny :)
- What is thought process in terms of nutrition?
    - there will be variety
    - might not have exact nutrition facts, but will have ingredients listed out
    - will have some healthy things
    - cognizant of dietary restrictions: vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, etc.
        - Steve’s fiancee is allergic to many things
            - “good you’re a chef\!” \- Mark
    - will look into having lots of options
    - allergies are important, does not mess with them :), being an allergy-safe
      kitchen is extremely important
        - allergens will be communicated very clearly
- What are you most excited about?
    - “what a great question\!” \- Faith
    - “there’s so many\!” \- Steve
    - state-of-the-art POS system (point of sale) \- lots of fun pieces \- fun
      kiosks to order, a free-standing kiosk like at McDonald’s
    - groceries will be great and unique, totally different from Concord store
        - At the Concord store, they “exist in the natural channel” \- no
          Cheetos, etc. \- but at the MIT store, they will have some of those
          conventional things
    - “lots of new toys for me downstairs” \- Steve (referring to kitchen
      equipment)
        - doesn’t have a hot service area in Concord, so this will be exciting
        - some things don’t hold cold
        - “I’m a big fan not of a good sandwich, but of \*_A Good Sandwich\*”_
    - excited about building culinary brand, excited to see what people
      like/dislike
    - wouldn’t be a part of this if they didn’t enjoy food
    - excited to have fun with food :)
    - they have a type of coffee \- Mark says it’s “a really good coffee”
- Mark \- up until mid-December, Dunkins operator was bringing in new
  point-of-sale system to have reward points and such, but they haven’t gotten
  it yet
    - at a lot of the Dunkins in the area, 75% of business is mobile order
    - the POS person Concord Market works with recommends not starting with
      mobile anything
    - Faith wants to be first with mobile-ordering, of the places on campus\!
