### Rescheduling CPW GBM

* don’t want to add more on people’s plates for current April 17th GBM  
* could reschedule for earlier that week, or cancel exec meeting and put it in a different week  
* currently scheduled for BC \- need to see if BC can host at the new time  
* Jackson \- makes most sense to replace an exec meeting with GBM? so that people don’t have other commitments  
* following GBM (May 1st) is elections  
  * last “real” GBM  
* April 24th vs 10th?  
* Jackson \- maybe April 24th so it’s closer to end of semester, since following one won’t really be real  
* **April 24th at 7pm** \- dorms can check?  
* BC should be ok with hosting then

### REX.

* OFY always wants to have blackout times with no events till 7pm. usually end up with a bad compromise, process isn’t as good as it should be  
* no REX events at all before 7pm :(  
  * because people aren’t showing up to Orientation events  
* they’re not Supposed to be fun, they’re supposed to be informative :/  
  * they can do things in a fun way  
  * what they’re doing won’t get people to show up  
  * combined expertise \- we could help them run better events?  
* there are already blackout times during the day  
  * gets stressful for REX chairs \- when they change the blackout time at the last moment  
  * I remember this 🙁  
* meals are also always a question \- should they be blackout times?  
* blackout \= Orientation \+ meals  
* what would satisfy dorms?  
* Hanu \- what’s their idea of what prefrosh do that whole time? if they black out all the time before 7pm?  
  * Farin \- they had a brief meeting with OFY, blackout times exist so there’s no competition between official events \+ REX events, not clear why it would be more strict than when the orientation events are \- events would be like 10-12 or 2-4  
  * other question \- if REX events have food and people don’t go to dining, there’s a food insecurity concern  
  * what is a successful orientation?  
    * other option could be online module \- if people don’t show up, they could do the module instead  
    * they want people to Have the info  
    * they take attendance at events, people who don’t show up can do online module  
  * clarifying question from Bianca \- as a prefrosh, there were modules over the summer that took a while, unclear why more is needed  
    * question of improving the modules?  
  * Gabe \- modules are still a thing, but they’re outsourced (not directly from MIT)  
    * some content is irrelevant, doesn’t have stuff like 617-253-1212  
  * presentations at orientation are largely outsourced  
    * sex talk from improv group  
    * other DEI guy  
    * they’re trying to make them more in-house  
* benefit to modules \- you have to answer questions afterwards  
  * do mandatory orientation events actually make a difference? modules might not be great either, but at least you have to answer questions?  
* Ananda \- universities have to do orientation events for legality/liability reasons  
  * no one else has REX, other places just have orientation  
* Geoffrey \- on CUP with Farin \- had meeting about orientation that included Elizabeth  
  * main focus was ASEs, but also touched on orientation  
  * discretion because it’s an Institute committee  
  * all the orientation things happen because of a freshman death in 1997  
  * OFY would be very against moving things to online modules, they find these things important, it’s hard to convince them to move something like alcohol abuse or sexual assault modules to different platform, and in this political climate  
    * if it makes the news that MIT removes Inclusion event for first years  
  * Helena has been an orientation leader and a first year  
    * not advocating for removing orientation events  
    * if they’re worried about competition \- why isn’t it just split them \- make one two days and the other two days  
    * Farin \- they did bring that up, it was discussed  
      * they had a reason why it wouldn’t be good, but doesn’t recall what it was, will bring it up again  
  * Haylea \- they know all this and know a lot of what they’re going to say, we know that blacking out All the time will not make frosh go  
    * another framing  
    * if there’s nothing all day, people are more likely to go off somewhere for the day or go to unofficial REX events  
    * REX events between orientation events will keep the frosh around and on campus  
  * Jackson \- if REX events are blacked out till 7pm, there will be a ton of events at night and they’ll run late  
    * other natural consequence \- fewer REX events  
  * Ella \- clarification to what Farin said  
    * concerned about food security \- mealtime events provide more food  
    * orientation and dining are supposed to provide the food, but if people skip those and just eat junk food at REX events, also bad for people with allergies or strict dietary requirements  
    * then people can Choose between REX events and dining  
    * Elizabeth has heard students say things like, they go to a REX event and there’s no food, but by the time they leave, the Orientation event with food has ended  
    * if people are following their friends, they’re not as likely to go find food elsewhere  
    * should clarify to frosh they shouldn’t be relying on REX events for food?  
    * would be good to have clearer info on REX events on exactly what kind of food will be there  
      * e.g., which dietary restrictions are met, snacks vs. full meal  
  * other idea \- adding an extra day of REX that doesn’t conflict with Orientation  
    * problem is that parents are around :(  
    * we don’t want parents around during REX  
    * requires moving move-in day by a day?  
  * this convo happens every year \- goal is to tackle this early, animosity between OFY and REX chairs/people in dorms  
    * at the end of the day \- we all want the prefrosh to feel welcome and prepared\!\!  
  * Bianca \- as a prefrosh, was told by upperclassmen which Orientation events were worth going to, has now told prefrosh which ones are good  
    * there is a network of informal communication where upperclassmen tell prefrosh what’s worth doing  
    * Ananda \- OFY complains about this (students telling prefrosh not to go)  
      * then, shouldn’t give the prefrosh an Option not to go  
      * attendance has been decreasing in past couple years  
  * Jackson \- during REX/orientation, felt like needed to go to orientation events, was sad because there were REX events that conflicted with orientation events :(  
    * theoretically, not supposed to conflict  
  * Gabriel \- argument against providing tangible consequence to not showing up?  
    * there would be backlash, admin doesn’t let them  
    * MIT is not like other girls  
    * not that crazy to have a consequence for not attending?  
  * Jackson \- could be deal to take attendance for events, but only for most important ones, and then have less strict blackout times?  
  * Helena \- what is the consequence of not attending?  
  * Orientation is so long, every day, isn’t worth time, too early in the morning :(  
  * shorten orientation schedule? get same info  
  * if REX events only at 7pm, they’ll run late and people will sleep late  
  * the upperclassmen are going to be around, doing Something…  
  * they’re worried about the fire hose, REX+Orientation being Too Much  
    * especially Helen  
    * tumult of everything at once  
    * hard to get it across to them that it’s Not too much, “MIT is a firehose, at least this one’s kind of fun” \- Ananda  
  * it’s really important to bond with people during REX, getting to know living community  
  * moving some things to modules would be good (disperse over summer) \- if you don’t go to event, have to do training module  
  * REX events keep prefrosh on campus\! otherwise people just Go To Boston  
  * purpose of REX events \- for students to decide where they want to live \- important for people to be able to make informed decision?  
    * vast majority of students stay in their dorms  
    * not the Most important goal of REX anymore  
    * more about getting to know people  
* hopefully will improve system and maybe have fewer problems in the future?
